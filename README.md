# Matthew Portfolio Website 3.0 (2022)
 
 **Matthew Rungwe Portfolio Website 3.0** is the third version of my website. It was inspired by **Dennis Ivanov**, a Full Stack Web Developer focusing on Django, React and content creation on YouTube. 


 I started working on the website on the 29th of July 2022 and finished on the 1st of August 2022.

 ## Features

- The website was built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScipt. 
- Flexbox and Grids are well used to setup the outline of the project.
- JavaScript is used to manage the changes in the theme color and save the theme in localStorage so the page keeps the theme even after refreshing.
- For version control, I used Git and pushed all changes to GitHub.
